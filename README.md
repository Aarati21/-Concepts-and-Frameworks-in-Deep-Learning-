# Concepts-and-Frameworks-in-Deep-Learning

This is an extensive implemetation of some concepts and frameworks in Deep Learning from scratch. It is based off the fifth assignment (aka mini-project) of the class 16720A Computer Vision at Carnegie Mellon University. The detailed question is given in the file titled Question. This is a basic overview of the contents
